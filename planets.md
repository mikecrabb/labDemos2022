#Pluto

Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It was the first object discovered in the Kuiper belt, in 1930. It was declared the ninth planet from the Sun, though it was always the odd object out. Following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt and scattered disc starting in the 1990s, particularly the more massive dwarf planet Eris, Pluto's status as a planet was increasingly questioned. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally re-defined the term planet to exclude Pluto, which was classified as a dwarf planet. (Many planetary astronomers, however, consider dwarf planets to be a category of planet.)

Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Compared to Earth's moon, Pluto has only one sixth its mass and one third its volume.
